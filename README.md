**Option 2: Legacy Session-Based Authentication**

1. **Generate a secure admin password**:
   ```bash
   python generate_admin_password.py
   ```

2. **Update your env.local file** with the generated password hash:
   ```bash
   ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your-generated-hash-here
   ```

3. **Access the admin dashboard**:
   - Go to the "Admin" tab in the application
   - Login with username: `admin` and your chosen password
   - View statistics, manage files, and monitor usage

**Note**: Firebase authentication is the new standard and provides better security and user experience.
