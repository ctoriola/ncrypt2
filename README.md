# NCryp - Secure Encrypted File Transfer

NCryp is a secure client-side encrypted file transfer application that allows users to upload files with end-to-end encryption and share them with others using unique share IDs.

## Features

### üîê **Client-Side Encryption**
- Files are encrypted in your browser before upload using AES-GCM
- Your data never leaves your device unencrypted
- Uses Web Crypto API for secure encryption

### üì§ **Easy File Sharing**
- Upload files and get a unique 8-character share ID
- Share the ID with anyone to let them download your encrypted file
- No accounts or registration required

### üîç **Simple File Discovery**
- Search for files using share IDs
- Download encrypted files shared with you
- Clean, intuitive interface

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**
- Malware scanning with ClamAV (optional)
- File type validation
- Size limits and security checks
- Multiple storage backend support

### üìä **Admin Dashboard**
- Monitor visitor statistics and analytics
- Track file uploads and downloads
- View all stored files and metadata
- Secure admin authentication

### üì± **Modern UI**
- Responsive design for all devices
- Dark mode support
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Progress tracking

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Drag and drop a file, enter a passphrase, and get a share ID
2. **Share**: Send the share ID to anyone you want to share the file with
3. **Download**: Recipients enter the share ID to download the encrypted file
4. **Decrypt**: Use the original passphrase to decrypt the file
5. **Monitor**: Use the admin dashboard to track usage and manage files

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd NCryp
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp env.example env.local
   # Edit env.local with your configuration
   ```

5. **Set up admin credentials**
   ```bash
   python generate_admin_password.py
   # Follow the instructions to set up admin password
   ```

6. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   start.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   ./start.sh
   ```

   Or run manually:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   python server.py
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create an `env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=true
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your-generated-password-hash
ADMIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600

# File Upload Settings
MAX_FILE_SIZE=104857600  # 100MB in bytes
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=pdf,txt,jpg,jpeg,png,gif,doc,docx,xls,xlsx,csv,zip,rar

# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_TYPE=local  # local, s3, gcs, azure

# Local Storage
LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=./uploads

# AWS S3 (optional)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name

# Google Cloud Storage (optional)
GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name

# Azure Blob Storage (optional)
AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING=your-connection-string

CLAMAV_ENABLED=false
```

### Setting Up Admin Access

1. **Generate a secure admin password**:
   ```bash
   python generate_admin_password.py
   ```

2. **Update your env.local file** with the generated password hash:
   ```bash
   ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your-generated-hash-here
   ```

3. **Access the admin dashboard**:
   - Go to the "Admin" tab in the application
   - Login with username: `admin` and your chosen password
   - View statistics, manage files, and monitor usage

### Storage Backends

NCryp supports multiple storage backends:

- **Local Storage** (default): Files stored on local filesystem
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage with Amazon S3
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Cloud storage with Google Cloud
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Cloud storage with Microsoft Azure

See [STORAGE_SETUP.md](STORAGE_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Usage
